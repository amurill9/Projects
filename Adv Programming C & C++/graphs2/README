This is a Graph ADT that represents a graph as an array of Lists. Each vertex will be associated
with an integer label in the range 1 to n, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. 


This package contains a Graph module in C that implements Depth First Search (DFS). This Graph
module finds the strongly connected components of a digraph.
