This is a Graph ADT that represents a graph as an array of Lists. Each vertex will be associated
with an integer label in the range 1 to n, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. This program uses
this Graph ADT to find shortest paths (i.e. paths with the fewest edges) between pairs of vertices. The
client program using your Graph ADT is called FindPath, and will take two command line arguments with the input 
and output file names.
