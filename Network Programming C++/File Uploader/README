Description:
	Each ccp file is in charge of creating the main program for the client and server
	and each have their own header files. Due poor time management I could not finish
	the assignment, but atleast all of the logic is present. 

	The serve receives packets and prints them out to stdout. The only change needed to 
	make was to send as a first line of the packet the file name, and then process the
	argument and use it to create a file with the corresponding name. I managed to send
	first the filename but had no time to parse it into the name of the new file.

	Also, the server does not repond with the echo file. This is simply just do exaclty 
	what I did with the client pogram in the server program, reading from the newly crea-
	ted text file. This implementation is trivial, so I hope the logic behind it is shown
	in the rest of the code. If I had a bit more time I would implement this.

	All errors are sent to cerr with a helpful error message.
